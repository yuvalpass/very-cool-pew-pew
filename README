explain three different decision:

1)if to create an additional class that will contain list of torpedo objects and a list or other variable that will
identify the use of the special move.soo its possible to add more special attacks in this class( Arsenal)

-this option gives the programmer the flexibility to change and to add different stuff to the game with out touching
 the other classes. making it more safe for him from ruining the program and easier to find bugs with the added code
