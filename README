======================

explain three different decision:

1)special moves:
We had to decide whether to create an additional class that will contain list of torpedo objects and a list or other variable that will
identify the use of the special move.soo its possible to add more special attacks in this class( Arsenal)

-this option gives the programmer the flexibility to change and to add different stuff to the game without touching
 the other classes. making it more safe for him from ruining the program and easier to find bugs with the added code.
 
 we decided not to add this class because we wanted the special move to act exactly like the existing torpedos
 and to have their cualities.
 
 2) move the object:
 We had a choise whether to define the object movements in the main game or in each class seperatlly.
 
 - defining the movement for each object gives more flexability and is easier to controll and give specific features.
 
 we evantually decided to define the move method in the main game so it will work the same for all the objects in the game. We thougth
 it was best to give all the game objects the same movment cuallities and keep all the monitoring data in the game class.
 that way the game "knows" all about the objects while the objects "takes orders" from the game alone.
 
 3)where to keep the arsenal limitations:
 We needed to decide where we should handle the arsenal limitetion, the number of torpedos allowed and existing.
 
 - storing these methods in the ship class makes sense, beacause the ship is in charge of firing the torpetos and all of the
 torpedos are fired _from_ the ship.
 
 we however chose to handle the arsenal from the main game. that way all of the action is operated from the main game class.
 no class operates anything in the game except the main game. That way the code in more stractured, readable and easy to alter.
 
 
 explain the special move:
 The special move makes the ship apin full circle (360 degrees) and for each 45 
 degrees that the ship passes it shoots one torpedo. After it finishes the move the ship shot 8 times and continues flying the same direction
